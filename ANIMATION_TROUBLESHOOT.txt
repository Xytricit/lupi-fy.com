ANIMATION UPLOAD TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
==========================================

Problem: "I pressed Create Animation and nothing happened"

Diagnostic Steps:
================

1. MODAL APPEARED?
   [ ] Yes → Go to step 2
   [ ] No → 
       - Reload page (Ctrl+F5)
       - Check you clicked "🎬 Upload Sprite Sheet" button
       - Check browser console (F12) for errors
       - Verify file is PNG/JPG

2. COULD YOU FILL THE FORM?
   [ ] Yes → Go to step 3
   [ ] No →
       - Form fields not showing = modal didn't render properly
       - Refresh page and try again
       - Try smaller image file

3. DID YOU CLICK "CREATE ANIMATION"?
   [ ] Yes, button was clickable → Go to step 4
   [ ] No, button was grayed out or disabled →
       - Fill all fields with valid numbers
       - Make sure "Frames Per Row" doesn't exceed image width/height
       - Check form has no obvious issues

4. WHAT HAPPENED AFTER CLICKING?
   [ ] Modal closed, toast appeared → SUCCESS! Go to VERIFY section
   [ ] Modal closed, nothing appeared →
       - Open F12 console
       - Look for messages starting with "Creating animation..."
       - Report what you see
   [ ] Modal is still there →
       - Button might not have worked
       - Check browser console (F12) for red errors
       - Click button again
   [ ] Error alert popped up →
       - Copy the error message exactly
       - See ERROR MESSAGES section below

5. VERIFY ANIMATION CREATED
   [ ] In Asset Panel, click "🎬 Animations" tab
   [ ] Do you see your animation listed?
       [ ] Yes! → ✅ WORKS - Skip to NEXT STEPS
       [ ] No → Go to CHECKING STORAGE

6. CHECKING STORAGE
   [ ] Open browser console (F12)
   [ ] Type and press Enter:
       console.log(AssetManager.assets.animations);
   [ ] Do you see your animation in the output?
       [ ] Yes (array with your animation) → 
           - Animation exists but UI not showing
           - Refresh page and check Animations tab again
       [ ] Empty array [] →
           - Animation was not saved
           - Check console for "Saved to localStorage" message
       [ ] Error message →
           - See ERROR MESSAGES below


COMMON ERROR MESSAGES:
=====================

ERROR: "Cannot read property 'animations' of undefined"
FIX: AssetManager not initialized
  - Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
  - Wait for page to fully load before uploading
  - Check network tab (F12 > Network) for failed requests

ERROR: "showToast is not defined"
FIX: Page didn't load completely
  - Wait 3 seconds after page loads
  - Refresh page
  - Check console for other errors

ERROR: "Modal is null"
FIX: Modal HTML didn't create
  - This is a serious error, page likely broken
  - Refresh page (Ctrl+F5)
  - Try accessing editor from fresh tab

ERROR: "Cannot read property 'querySelector'"
FIX: Button click happened but modal is gone
  - Modal element removed before button processed
  - Try clicking button again slowly
  - Or reload and try different file

BROWSER CONSOLE NOT SHOWING MESSAGES?
======================================

If you don't see log messages like "Creating animation...":

Option 1: Check logs
  - F12 → Console tab
  - Filter by "Creating" to find animation logs
  - Should see 7-8 messages for successful creation

Option 2: Check for errors
  - Look for any RED text in console
  - Copy exact error message
  - Those errors are the real problem

Option 3: Manual test
  - F12 → Console tab
  - Copy paste this:
    
    AssetManager.showSpriteSheetConfig('test.png', 
      'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANS...', 256, 64);
  
  - This manually triggers the modal
  - If modal appears, upload file is the issue
  - If nothing, modal code has a problem


NEXT STEPS AFTER SUCCESSFUL CREATION:
=====================================

1. Your animation is in localStorage now
2. It appears in 🎬 Animations tab
3. Click animation → see Animation Editor
   - Preview canvas shows first frame
   - Buttons let you see each frame
   - Can edit name and duration
   - Can set tags

4. To use in game:
   - Add "🎬 Play Animation" block
   - Select your animation from dropdown
   - Select tag (or create new tagged sprites)
   - Block will play animation on all entities with that tag

5. Optional: Add keyframes
   - Create keyframes for movement
   - Combine with animation for walking sprites that move


STILL STUCK?
===========

Provide these details:
1. Does the modal appear? (Yes/No)
2. What do you see in browser console (F12 > Console)?
3. Any red error messages?
4. What's the image size? (e.g., 256x128)
5. What values did you enter? (frames/row, total frames, duration)

These details will pinpoint the exact issue!
